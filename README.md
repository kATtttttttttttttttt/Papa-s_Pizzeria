Project Development Timeline
1. Requirements (3 days)
•	Talk with representatives of Papa Pizza and identify the pizza shop’s requirements and document the requirements that need to be met. 
2. Design (1 week)
•	Design an algorithm flowchart highlighting all features of the program. 
•	Brainstorm a user-friendly interface for quick access of certain features via a touch screen, using wireframes.
•	Select appropriate frameworks to meet hardware compatibility. 
3. Implementation and Testing (5 weeks)
•	Contact third-party services in means of databases, payment, and general management. 
•	Develop the back-end programs for receiving and processing orders; tracking cumulative totals; additional home delivery charges; loyalty discounts; addition of Goods and Service Tax (GST). 
•	Trial testing of the program. 
•	Trial testing within the pizza shop’s kiosk systems during the shop’s inactive hours.  
4. Deployment (1 week)
•	Deploy the application to the pizza shop’s servers via the use of a cloud hosting platform. 
•	Train staff on kiosk usage with application implementation. 
•	Actively monitor the application usage on initial days of launch. 
5. Future Support (Ongoing)
•	Provision of ongoing support and application maintenance via company support or subcontractors. 



Project Outline
•	To develop a software solution for Papa Pizza, with the goal of using a system to maintain calculation and management tasks when pizza orders take place, to be used by employees of the shop. 
•	This includes functions like:
o	Receiving and Processing Orders.
o	Calculating costs of individual pizzas. 
o	Tracking the cumulative total . 
o	Providing a daily summary of the quantities sold
o	Accounting for specific discounts and surcharges. 
	Homedelivery.

	GST addition.
•	Therefore, making it easier for the business to efficiently manage in-store and delivery-based orders.  
Project Description
Objective
•	This system is for employees to effectively manage and calculate costs for various orders in an efficient manner. 
Discounts and Surcharges 
•	Back-end programming will account for such measures, with a terminal based application for the employee to select options. 
Tracking Orders and Daily Sales
•	Using back-end programming, information will be stored in long-term storage via a file. 
Requirement List
Functional Requirements
•	Order Placement and Processing: Employees can select specific options through terminal menu, and don’t stop application until quit is selected as an option. 
•	Cost Calculation: Total cost is calculated based on items selected (with set prices) as well as discounts and surcharges (including 10% GST). 
•	Sales Tracking: Sales data is recorded into a notepad file in cloud/server of the shop, allowing for later analysis of the data for marketing improvements. 
•	Discount Application: $8.00 delivery fee; 5% discount to members with a loyalty card or if the orders exceed $100. 


Non-Functional Requirements
•	Usability: Interface for employee usage with quick and efficient functions.  
•	Performance: Light-weight application for speed and reliability. 
•	Security: Encrypted storage procedures and secure payment architecture through trusted third-party services. 
•	Legal: Compliance with financial laws and privacy laws.
